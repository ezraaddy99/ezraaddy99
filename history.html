    <h1>Beginning</h1>
    <p>The Salvation Army started their journey in 1865 when London minister, William Booth, gave up the comfort and decide to go to street where there the minister can reach for poor, the homeless, the hungry and the destitute.  It is not his original aim but upon see and realized that the poor did not feel comfortable and welcome the church and chapels of Victorian England.</p>
   <p>Because of that, he decide to start a church especially for the poor and name the church as East London Christian Mission.  In May 1878, Booth summoned his Bramwell and his good friend, George Railton to read a proof of Christian Mission's annual report which state, THE CHRISTIAN MISSION is A VOLUNTEER ARMY.  But Booth said it is not volunteer but it is a willingness to do God's work.  Because of that, Booth get an idea and crossed out "Volunteer" and change it to "Salvation".  Therefore, The Salvation Army was born</p>
   <p>The Army had spread around the world in year 1900s.  It had the office and soldiers in 36 inlcude Unites States of America.
